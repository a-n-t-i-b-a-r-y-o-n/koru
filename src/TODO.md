## Features
_Specific, unimplemented things that other people or future me might want_
  
- [ ] __Search__  
Don't really use this myself, so just haven't done it yet.
  
- [ ] __URLs/Deep Linking__  
This is probably next up on the to-do.

## Incomplete
_Areas of the code that could use improvement_


- [ ] __Errors__  
Device-level errors are all Strings instead of proper Error types.
  

- [ ] __Magic packets__  
Currently using a crate for this, should at least audit it.  
How is it crafting raw ICMP packets without root privileges?

## Brainstorming
_Half-baked feature ideas, avenues to explore, potential ~~attack~~ **fun** vectors_

### Private listening
Seems like an incredibly valuable feature-add, though AFAIUI the implementation is proprietary.  
Will continue... research ðŸ˜ˆ

### Info keys to explore
* `supports-ecs-microphone`  
  Is this a mic that's **part of** or **connecting to** the device?
* `supports-ecs-textedit`  
  This might be fun from a security perspective.  
  Arbitrary string handling?
